# facebook_login_page_clone
## My first Flutter project
### In this project, I focused on UI design.
### The project aims to create a login screen similar to the Facebook login page using Flutter widgets and UI components.
## INFO
### The "images" folder contains the Facebook background image that I cropped from the reference and made some edits to.
### The "ref" folder contains the reference image from which I cloned the UI.
### The Facebook icon data is from the Flutter library.
