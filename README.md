# facebook_login_page_clone
### My First Simple Project: In this project, I learned the basics of working with the Flutter development environment, including handling rows and columns, and using pre-built widgets.
### I also added images and fonts to the project files, which helped me gain a fundamental understanding of user interface design and implementation.
## INFO
### The "images" folder contains the Facebook background image that I cropped from the reference and made some edits to.
### The "ref" folder contains the reference image from which I cloned the UI.
### The Facebook icon data is from the Flutter library.
